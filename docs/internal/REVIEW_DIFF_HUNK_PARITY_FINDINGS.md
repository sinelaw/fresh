# Review Diff (hunk-parity) — Interactive Testing Findings

Status: open issues found by driving the in-panel hunk-parity Review Diff
interactively in tmux (unified + side-by-side, single- and multi-file
changesets, with `capture-pane -e`). Companion to
`REVIEW_DIFF_HUNK_PARITY_UX_DESIGN.md`. None of these are fixed yet.

Read CONTRIBUTING.md before starting. The plugin lives in
`crates/fresh-editor/plugins/audit_mode.ts`; composite-buffer host code in
`crates/fresh-editor/src/app/composite_buffer_actions.rs`,
`crates/fresh-editor/src/app/input_helpers.rs`, and the composite renderer
in `crates/fresh-editor/src/view/ui/split_rendering/orchestration/mod.rs`.

## Resolution log

- **A1 — FIXED** (`6093f61`): composite handlers resolved the panel leaf via
  `active_split()` (outer group leaf) instead of `effective_active_pair()`
  (focused inner leaf), so the `composite_view_states` lookup missed and all
  keyboard movement / hunk nav was dropped. Side-by-side now scrolls
  (Up/Down/PageUp/PageDown) and `n`/`p` navigate hunks.
- **A2 — CORRECTED + FIXED** (`2c397c4`): `n`/`p` weren't "doing nothing" —
  they moved the highlight + scrolled, but (a) the status-bar `Ln` lagged and
  (b) in focus-only mode they used the *global* `state.hunks` index, so when
  the focused file wasn't first the jump targeted an unrendered file and
  no-op'd. Now navigate by the rendered `hunkHeaderRows` (advancing files at
  boundaries); `set_buffer_cursor_in_splits` updates `primary_cursor_line_number`
  so `Ln` is correct immediately.
- **A3 — FIXED (test)** (`260316c`): the stash review feature works; the e2e
  test asserted a title string (`"Review Diff (stash"`) that is never
  rendered (panels are labelled with the stash ref), so it timed out at 180s
  on every platform. Assertion corrected to the actually-rendered strings.
- **A4 — FIXED** (`f876884`): the `[⚠]` bump came from the composite fold on
  `Tab`; `Tab` is now focus-switch, so it no longer fires.
- **B1 — FIXED** (`2c397c4`): navigating files (`,`/`.`) scrolls the focused
  file into position and puts the cursor on its header.
- **B2 — FIXED** (`HEAD`): the FILES panel scrolls to keep the selected file
  visible when the changeset is taller than the sidebar.
- **C1/C2/C3 — FIXED** (`f876884`): `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` cycle focus
  files → diff → comments; arrows/PageUp/PageDown act on the focused panel; a
  `▸` marker on the focused panel header shows where input lands.
- **D1 — FIXED** (`HEAD`): toolbar legend now leads with the nav keys
  (Tab/`,`/`.`/`n`/`p`/`1`/`2`/`↑↓`).
- **D3 — FIXED** (`f876884`): help text updated to match (Tab = focus, not
  fold).

Remaining: **B3** (side-by-side already scrolls to the first hunk via the
composite's focus-hunk logic — largely covered by A1; revisit only if a
specific case misbehaves) and **D2** (`?` help opens in a new tab and steals
focus — should be an overlay or restore focus on close).

## A. Broken behavior (functional bugs)

### A1. Side-by-side: keyboard cursor movement is completely frozen  — FIXED (6093f61)
`Up`/`Down`/`j`/`k`/`PageUp`/`PageDown` do nothing in split view — the
cursor stays at `Ln 1, Col 1` and the composite never scrolls, so anything
below the first viewport is unreachable. Unified mode moves fine.

Path is confirmed correct up to the host: `Down → review_nav_down →
editor.executeAction("move_down") → handle_action → catch-all →
apply_action_as_events`, which checks `is_composite_buffer(active_buffer())`
(true — status bar shows `*Review: <file>*`) and calls
`handle_composite_action(MoveDown)`. That function bails early at:

```rust
let split_id = …active_split();
let _view_state = self.active_window()
    .composite_view_states.get(&(split_id, buffer_id))?;   // <-- likely None
```

The render path lazily creates the view-state keyed by `(split_id,
buffer_id)` for the leaf the composite renders in
(`orchestration/mod.rs` ~L429). Strong suspicion: `active_split()` returns a
different leaf than the diff-panel leaf the composite is rendered under, so
the lookup misses and movement is dropped. **Next step:** add tracing in
`handle_composite_action` for `active_split` vs the keys present in
`composite_view_states`, confirm the mismatch, and resolve the correct leaf
(or create/sync the view-state under `active_split`).

### A2. Hunk navigation `n` / `p` does nothing (unified focus mode)
Cursor never moves between hunks regardless of position (pressed repeatedly
from `Ln 6`, stayed at `Ln 6`). Likely the hunk-row model is computed
against the full multi-file stream while the focus-only buffer renders only
the focused file's body, so the target rows don't line up with the rendered
buffer. Verify `review_next_hunk`/`review_prev_hunk` row math against the
focus-only `buildDiffLines` output.

### A3. Stash review hangs
`Review Stash` → `start_review_stash` → `bootstrapRangeReview` with
`git stash show -p` times out (180s). Reproduced locally on Linux and on all
three CI runners (macOS / Ubuntu / Windows) via
`e2e::plugins::review_diff_hunk_parity::test_review_stash_shows_stashed_diff`
— this single bug is what is currently reddening PR #2271's CI. Likely hangs
interactively too, not just under test.

### A4. `[⚠]` warning counter increments on composite Tab
In side-by-side, pressing `Tab` bumps the editor warning/error indicator
(`[⚠ 1]` → `[⚠ 2]` …), suggesting the fold handler throws in composite
context. Investigate `review_toggle_file_collapse` when the diff panel hosts
a composite buffer.

## B. Navigation / scroll-positioning gaps

### B1. Navigating to a file does not scroll that file to the top
`,` / `.` collapses the other files and expands the target, but the view
stays anchored at the `UNSTAGED` header — the focused file's diff appears
several rows down and the cursor stays at `Ln 1`. Expectation: moving to a
file should bring that file to the top (best-fit) of the diff viewport and
place the cursor there.

### B2. Sidebar does not auto-scroll to the selected file
With a changeset larger than the sidebar height (verified at 27 files),
navigating past the visible window leaves the selection off-screen with no
highlight — the FILES panel never scrolls to follow `filesCurrentKey`.

### B3. Hunk nav and side-by-side need the same scroll-to-position
The best-fit-to-top behavior from B1 should also apply when jumping hunks
(`n`/`p`) and in side-by-side. Currently unmet (compounded by A1/A2).

---

## C. Focus model

### C1. No `Tab` focus cycling between panels
Expectation: `Tab` cycles file list → OLD pane → NEW pane → back to file
list (and the diff pane in stacked view). Currently `Tab` = fold; in
side-by-side the review-mode `Tab` binding shadows the composite's native
`InsertTab → composite_focus_next`, so pane focus never switches.

### C2. Cursor keys should act on the focused panel
`Up`/`Down`/`PageUp`/`PageDown` should drive whichever panel has focus.
Today arrows only ever target the diff (and in side-by-side not even that —
see A1); the file list is reachable only via `,`/`.` and comments only via
backtick. There is no "focused panel receives cursor keys" concept.

### C3. No visible focus indicator
Nothing shows which pane currently holds keyboard focus, so even the
existing backtick→comments focus switch is invisible.

---

## D. Discoverability / polish

### D1. Top-bar legend omits the primary navigation keys
The two persistent toolbar rows show `n/p`, `s/u/d`, `Tab`, `Enter`, etc.,
but not `,`/`.` (file nav) or `1`/`2`/`0` (layout toggle) — exactly the keys
a newcomer needs. They appear only in the `?` help screen.

### D2. `?` help hijacks the view
Help opens as a new `*Review Keys*` tab and steals focus; review-mode keys
stop working there and there is no "press q/Esc to return" affordance.
Should be an overlay, or restore focus to the review on close.

### D3. Help text vs. behavior mismatch
Help says "Tab — fold the file under the cursor," but `Tab` actually folds
the **hunk** under the cursor.

---

## E. Validated as working (no action needed)

- File nav `,`/`.` updates the sticky header + sidebar highlight in both
  layouts; clamps at the top boundary (no wrap).
- Up/Down + cursor-line overlay in **unified** mode.
- Side-by-side composite rendering (OLD/NEW alignment is correct).
- **No `[No Name]` tab churn and no flicker** across repeated side-by-side
  file switches (the earlier regression is fixed).

---

## Suggested fix order

1. **A1** — split-view scrolling (core of side-by-side).
2. **A2 / B1 / B3** — scroll-to-position for file and hunk nav (shared
   mechanism: compute a cursor/scroll target and apply per panel).
3. **C1 / C2 / C3** — `Tab` focus model + focus indicator.
4. **A3** — stash hang (unblocks PR CI).
5. **B2, D1–D3** — sidebar follow + discoverability polish.

A1, A2, and B1 likely share one underlying fix in how the cursor/scroll
target is computed and applied per panel.
